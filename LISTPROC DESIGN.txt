LISTPROC DESIGN
Moshix, Dec 19, 2019

Purpose: HNET-based forum with access from outside internet as well

Example:

MAINT@MOSHIX2 creates a new subject “PERFORMANCE of RELAY” by sending a file to RELAY with this format:
LISTPROC /CREATE PERFORMANCE RELAY
And then writes  a variable length mailing

He sends it to relay with a client program or by sendfile. 

RELAY stores it in an append-only LIST of files on this purpose and makes it searchable. 

User CCRAFT@NOODLE does a 
LISTPROC /SUBSCRIBE PERFORMANCE RELAY

And then gets copies of all discussions on this topic. To unsubscribe he send a file
LISTPROC /UNSUBSCRIBE PERFORMANCE RELAY

The client can also do a search with 
LISTPROC /SEARCH KEYWORDS KEYWORDS KEYWORDS

A list of discussions containing these keywords is returned. He can then

Do LISTPROC /RECEIVE the discussions he wants (up to 3 at a time) and RELAY will send a file with those discussions to the user.
